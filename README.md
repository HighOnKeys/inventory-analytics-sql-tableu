# Inventory Optimization Using Advanced SQL Analytics

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive approach to solving inventory inefficiencies using structured SQL queries and Tableau visualizations. It helps retail businesses uncover stock imbalances, optimize replenishment strategies, and align inventory with demand cycles.

## Objectives
- Identify stockout and overstock patterns.
- Calculate key performance indicators like Inventory Turnover, Stockout Rate, and Reorder Points.
- Detect slow-moving products and forecasting mismatches.
- Visualize demand trends and category-wise performance across seasons.

##  Tech Stack
- *SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)* — Core analytical queries.
- *Tableau* — Interactive dashboards and KPIs.
- *Excel/CSV* — Data source for transactional records.

## Key Features
- *KPI Dashboards*: Stockout Rate, Turnover Ratio, Avg Inventory Age.
- *Sales Forecast Comparison*: Actual vs Forecasted demand (by category/month).
- *Inventory Status*: Overstock vs Stockout days, inventory heatmaps.
- *Product Segmentation*: Fast-moving vs slow-moving items.
- *Seasonality Insights*: Category-level seasonal demand patterns.

## Sample Insights from the Project

-  *Product P0067: Over 1,400 days overstocked with **no stockouts* — signals excess holding cost.
-  *Clothing* category: Strong seasonal spikes in November–December but *under-forecasted*.
-  *Slow movers* like P0031 and P0085: High inventory age, low turnover — flagged for clearance.
-  *Winter season*: Highest total sales across all categories — critical for seasonal stocking strategy.

## Recommendations Implemented
- Replenish high-demand SKUs with proactive restocking.
- Adjust forecasting models for seasonal products.
- Identify clearance opportunities for slow-moving inventory.
- Align safety stock with actual stockout trends to reduce excess inventory.
- Enable automated alert systems based on KPI thresholds.
